Do a state machine.
When signal raise start counting and wait for low. data is -1, after 2T it become 0 after 2T t become 1 after 2T it become 2.
At low signal read data and jump to desire position.
The same can be done for 0, to detect end signal.
Data value -1 means to fast clock
0 : read 0 store
1 : read 1 store
>2 : end of frame.
Status waiting start, reading, 

Sony.
Header = 4T  + 12Bits data
0 = 1T + 1T
1 = 2T + 1T

Pseudo-Code
1. Wait for signal be High.
2. wait for low or T+1.5T or T+3T 
3. When low get data type it can be (0,1, header).
4. wait for 1.5T or signal high to consolidate this value the goto 2.

We need anotate time of level 1. and calculate time for 0,1, headers.
